# Newyork-Taxi-analysis

This project explores and analyzes the New York taxi data using Python. The primary focus is to perform data exploration and manipulation using tools like matplotlib, pandas, NumPy, and SciPy. The ultimate goal of the project was to develop a machine learning model to predict the tip amount of any taxi ride.

## Data Exploration

The data exploration process was performed to gain insights into the New York taxi data. The charts were plotted to understand the number of trips based on their distance and average speed. The results showed that 80% of the trips were less than 4 miles and the maximum average speed of cabs was at 4am.

## Data Manipulation

Data manipulation was performed using pandas, NumPy, and SciPy to clean and prepare the data for further analysis. This process involved missing value imputation, data normalization, and feature engineering.

## Model Development

The final stage of the project involved developing a machine learning model to predict the tip amount of any taxi ride. Multiple models were evaluated to determine the best model for this task. The results showed that the best results were obtained from the gradient regressor with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.3672 and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.5540.
